# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock game

This game is based on the classic rock, paper, scissors game with an extension of choices for more possibilities and less likeliness of draws. This version appeared first in the TV series The Big Bang Theory. This can be played as a hand game, usually played between two people. This website is a single-player version where you can play against the computer.

#### Typography
 * [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): Open Sans Condensed was used throughout the website.
#### Imagery
The icons I used for the choices are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/check-circle?style=solid).
Instead of using the same icons, I have made a picture display circle for both the player and the computer choice, using more realistic photos relating to the options.
The photos used are from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/sv-se/), [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) and [Stockvault](https://www.stockvault.net/).
On the rules page, I used the same icons as the option buttons on the main page for a clearer explanation.
